# Competitive Programming solutions

## 200+ problems solved

 It consists of **150+** solutions from codeForces, about **30** solutions from atCoder along with **50** solutions from codechef. 
 
 These problems use different techniques and concepts such as:
 - Recursion
 - Dynamic Programming
 - Graph problems with breath-first and depth-first search
 - Greedy algorithms
 - Combinatorics
 - Bitwise operations
 
 All the solutions in this repository are written using C++
